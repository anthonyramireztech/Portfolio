# Vulnerability scanning and remediation

	Utilized an outdated Windows 10 ISO and Tenable Nessus as the professional vulnerability scanner.
-	I installed an outdated Windows 10 ISO file and input the file into a VM to obtain active vulnerabilities within the virtual host.
-	Downloaded and installed Tenable Nessus on my main machine and prepared the scan by gathering IP addresses and credentials within the virtual host.

	Conducted the scan.
-	After gathering all the data needed to execute this scan, I input everything in the required sections and let the scan run on my main machine.

	Remediation/crunching the results.
-	gathering the results, the scan formed a set of critical vulnerabilities and a few highs for me. I then remediated them on the VM by performing the best practices about the vulnerability type. (e.g., Updating the operating system with a new version of Windows or upgrading to the latest version of Microsoft).

	Final Scan.
-	I scanned the same virtual machine again to ensure patches were properly carried out. There were little to no vulnerabilities left in the VM machine. The vulnerability assessment was thriving by creating a hardened host/network.
